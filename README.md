Dear professor 
<br>This is my old project [here](https://github.com/dralmadani/Data_Visualization)

The new project is here (this note will remove on 3 Nov 2020 or before)

# Data Visualization Project
Data visualization project proposal

----
## Data

1- The full data I propose to visualize for my project is about [the number of completed highest structures in the world cities](https://gist.github.com/dralmadani/aa84bd8088038464b94ef3c454b30f4d). Building greater than 100 meters was counted on the world map. 

 * Height represents the number of buildings.
 * Color represents the city.

2- Country boundaries from [World Atlas TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/world-atlas), polished for visual style, including graticules.

3- Colors inspired by [UNHCR Streamgraph Explorer](https://github.com/unhcr/dataviz-streamgraph-explorer/blob/7f30a1ff0157e031c74837294b170641f98a9c04/src/colorScale.js).

#### Structure of my data:
<br>[Cities Ranked by Number of Completed Structures](https://gist.github.com/dralmadani/aa84bd8088038464b94ef3c454b30f4d).
- You can find the original data for Cities Ranked by Number of Completed Buildings on [the skyscraper center](http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/cities)
- I add Latitude and Longitude one by one by using [Latitude and Longitude Finder](https://www.latlong.net/)
- I add the date for the First 150m+ Building by checking each city through [the skyscraper center](http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/cities) website.
note: I am still working on latitude and longitude for every city. (last update 1 Nov  2020)
I build a new Dataset.

#### The attribute
1- Rank
<br> 2- City
<br> 3- Country
<br> 4- AllBuilding: Number of building in the city
<br> 5- 100m: Building has 100m+
<br> 6- 200m: Building has 200m+
<br> 7- 300m: Building has 300m+
<br> 8- TelecomTowers: Radio masts and towers are typically tall structures designed to support antennas for telecommunications and broadcasting
<br> 9- AllStructures: All structures
<br> 9- lat: Latitude
<br> 9- lng: Longitude
<br> 9- first150m: the year of the first building higher than 150m+

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...
[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25451974/97809840-8848fe80-1c3d-11eb-8e4e-993d8c1ce517.png)](https://vizhub.com/dralmadani/538256d9d86047838d467f643a7cd303)

In the second visualization, I choose the top 10 ranks  to show  the population

In the third visualization, I created a menu to let the user choose the available years, density and land area

1st draft for Cities on the world map, later will improve to be on the USA map only

Cities on the USA map

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25451974/96820262-9e5fef00-13f3-11eb-97e4-46bdc273ad5d.png)](https://vizhub.com/dralmadani/e9a2b6197eb14b87aafbc85a09b90fe8)




enjoy looking at this graph :)

This visualization focuses on
- City
- State
- population 2010: the population in 2020
- population 2020: the population in 2020
- Density and Area

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

  * What are the top 200 largest cities in the USA in 2020 by population?
  * What are the top ten largest cities in the US by population in 2020 by population?
  * What are the top ten largest cities in the US by population in 2020 by density?
  * What are the top ten largest cities in the US by population in 2020 by area?
  * Which state has the largest cities?
  * How many large cities population in each state?

<br>This is the first sketching about my project and I hope those sketches drive the visualization.

<br>
General visualization for top cities by population then top states having those cities

<br>
Tring to show city name and population also, places in the USA map

## Open Questions


  - I'm not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data
  - I'm not sure how to get movement visualization to show the difference between the population from 2010 to 2020 for each city
