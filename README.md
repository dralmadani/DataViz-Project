# Data Visualization Project
Data visualization project proposal


## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is about [the Largest Cities population in US 2020](https://gist.github.com/dralmadani/c04f95746e2f36b040d3d764ab7b9c62)
Originally published at [World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities)

#### The attribute
 1- Rank
 2- City
 3- State
 4- usps : the Abbreviation for state
 5- pop2020 : the population in 2020
 6- pop2010 : the population in 2010
 7- change : the percentage between 2020 and 2010
 8- density: the density in each city (Km sqe)
 9- aland : the area for each city (Km sqe)

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

enjoy looking on this graph :)

This visualization focuses on
- City
- State
- pop2020 : the population in 2020

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

  * What are the top 200 largest cities in the USA in 2020 ?
  * What are the top ten Largest cities in US by population in 2020 ?
  * Which state has most largest cities ?
  * How many Large Cities Population in each state ?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

----
## Open Questions

  - I'm not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data
  - I'm not sure how to get movement visualization to show the difference between the population from 2010 to 2020 for each city
