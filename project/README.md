A world map showing the number of completed highest structures in cities. The building should be greater than 100 meters high to be counted.

 * Height represents the number of buildings.
 * Color represents the Rank/City.

City-data from [Cities Ranked by Number of Completed Structures](https://gist.github.com/dralmadani/aa84bd8088038464b94ef3c454b30f4d).

Country boundaries from [World Atlas TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/world-atlas), polished for visual style, including graticules.

I add Latitude and Longitude by using [Latitude and Longitude Finder](https://www.latlong.net/)
note: I am still working on latitude and longitude for every city. (last update 28 Oct  2020)

Colors inspired by [UNHCR Streamgraph Explorer](https://github.com/unhcr/dataviz-streamgraph-explorer/blob/7f30a1ff0157e031c74837294b170641f98a9c04/src/colorScale.js).
